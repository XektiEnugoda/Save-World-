A game in which you, the player, must collect 3 stars and swerve around a danger to collect 3 stars. 
The game is still in its demo phase as of now.

Ubuntu:
You need a folder with the Include folder under it, the Source folder under it 
as well as the makefile to run it.
In order to run, make sure you are in the right directory (cd path/to/SaveTheWorld or cd ~/SaveTheWorld)
and then in the terminal do make clean to remove the gamefile. 
Type make to create the gamefile and ./game to run the gamefile.
